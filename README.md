# MIPS-ISA-Simulator
this is a project for computer architectures lesson.
mips architecture is a way of proccessing the machin code and get hardware output of instructions.
in this code first I have written an assembler which transforms the assembly code to machine code and then this machin code will execute in pipeline method

## How to run
just edit the assembly.txt file and run the main.java and see the output level by level.
